# StarStrike: Game Design Document

## üéØ Game Vision

StarStrike reimagines space mining as a persistent, community-driven experience where every action has permanent on-chain consequences. Players don't just collect temporary resources‚Äîthey build lasting reputation, unlock permanent abilities, and collectively shape the game universe through DAO governance.

## üåå Game World & Setting

### The Asteroid Mining Consortium
In the year 2387, humanity has expanded into the outer solar system. Independent miners band together to form the **Cosmic Mining Consortium**‚Äîa decentralized organization that coordinates asteroid mining operations across multiple sectors.

### Key Locations
- **Central Station**: Hub for mission briefings, consortium governance, and ship upgrades
- **Asteroid Fields**: Procedurally generated mining zones with varying resource density
- **Deep Space Sectors**: High-risk, high-reward areas requiring advanced traits
- **Salvage Zones**: Derelict ship graveyards with rare materials and hidden dangers

## üéÆ Core Gameplay Loop

### 1. Mission Selection (Honeycomb Integration)
**On-Chain Mission System**: Honeycomb Protocol generates and tracks missions
- **Daily Quotas**: Extract X tons of specific minerals
- **Exploration Contracts**: Map uncharted asteroid clusters
- **Convoy Escort**: Protect mining ships through dangerous sectors
- **Emergency Response**: Rescue stranded miners or salvage operations

### 2. Ship Piloting & Mining
**3D Interactive Experience**:
- First-person ship controls with realistic physics
- Navigate through asteroid fields using radar and visual cues
- Deploy mining lasers and collection drones
- Manage ship systems (power, shields, cargo capacity)

### 3. Progress & Rewards
**Honeycomb Trait System**:
- Complete missions ‚Üí Earn XP and unlock trait upgrades
- Traits permanently modify ship capabilities and available missions
- Consortium rank advancement opens new sectors and governance rights

### 4. Consortium Governance
**DAO Decision Making**:
- Vote on new sector exploration (affects available missions)
- Approve safety regulations (changes mission difficulty/rewards)
- Resource allocation decisions (influences market prices)
- Emergency response protocols (unlocks special event missions)

## üîß Honeycomb Protocol Integration

### Mission System
```typescript
interface Mission {
  id: string;
  type: 'mining' | 'exploration' | 'escort' | 'salvage';
  requirements: TraitRequirement[];
  rewards: {
    xp: number;
    traits: TraitUpgrade[];
    resources: Resource[];
  };
  timeLimit: number;
  difficulty: 'rookie' | 'experienced' | 'expert' | 'elite';
}
```

### Trait Progression
```typescript
interface PlayerTraits {
  shipHandling: number;     // 0-100: Maneuverability and speed
  miningEfficiency: number; // 0-100: Resource extraction rate
  leadership: number;       // 0-100: Consortium voting power
  navigation: number;       // 0-100: Access to distant sectors
  combatSkills: number;     // 0-100: Defense against pirates
  engineering: number;      // 0-100: Ship system optimization
}
```

### Consortium Ranks
1. **Rookie Miner** (0-99 XP): Basic missions, local asteroids only
2. **Experienced Pilot** (100-499 XP): Intermediate missions, sector exploration
3. **Mining Foreman** (500-1499 XP): Team missions, policy voting rights
4. **Sector Chief** (1500-4999 XP): Advanced territories, resource allocation votes
5. **Board Member** (5000+ XP): Full governance, exclusive elite missions

## üé® Visual Design & 3D Environment

### Art Style
- **Realistic Space Aesthetic**: Dark space with bright stars and nebulae
- **Industrial Mining Theme**: Functional, weathered equipment and stations
- **Minimalist UI**: Clean, space-appropriate interface elements
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Engine trails, mining lasers, and asteroid explosions

### 3D Scene Composition
- **Central Station**: Modular space station with docking bays
- **Asteroid Fields**: Procedurally placed rocks with varying sizes and compositions
- **Ship Models**: Detailed mining vessels with visible equipment upgrades
- **Particle Effects**: Mining debris, engine exhausts, and explosion effects

### User Interface
- **HUD Elements**: Ship status, radar, mission objectives
- **Mission Board**: Interactive 3D terminal in station
- **Consortium Panel**: Governance interface with voting mechanisms
- **Progress Visualization**: 3D trait progression trees

## üéØ Player Progression & Engagement

### Short-term Goals (Daily)
- Complete daily mining quotas
- Participate in consortium votes
- Explore new asteroid clusters
- Upgrade ship components

### Medium-term Goals (Weekly)
- Advance consortium rank
- Unlock new sectors
- Master specific mission types
- Build coalition with other players

### Long-term Goals (Monthly+)
- Achieve board member status
- Lead major exploration initiatives
- Establish mining monopolies in rare sectors
- Shape consortium policies and future direction

## ü§ù Multiplayer & Social Features

### Cooperative Elements
- **Joint Missions**: Multi-player escort and salvage operations
- **Resource Sharing**: Pool materials for large construction projects
- **Coalition Building**: Form voting blocs for consortium governance
- **Mentorship**: Experienced players guide newcomers

### Competitive Elements
- **Efficiency Leaderboards**: Fastest mission completion times
- **Resource Race**: Competition for rare asteroid claims
- **Reputation Rankings**: Consortium influence and voting power
- **Sector Control**: Territorial influence through mission completion

## üìä Game Balance & Economy

### Mission Difficulty Scaling
- Trait requirements increase with rank
- Higher difficulty = better rewards
- Random events add unpredictability
- Player choices affect future mission availability

### Resource Economy
- Basic minerals: Common rewards for routine missions
- Rare elements: High-value materials from dangerous sectors
- Processed goods: Created through collaboration between players
- Consortium tokens: Governance currency earned through participation

### Progression Balance
- Linear XP requirements prevent grinding
- Multiple trait paths avoid single optimal strategy
- Consortium voting prevents individual player dominance
- Regular mission rotation maintains engagement

## üîÆ Future Expansion Possibilities

### Phase 2 Features
- **Ship Customization**: Visual and functional modifications
- **Player Housing**: Personal space stations and asteroid bases
- **Trading System**: Player-to-player resource exchange
